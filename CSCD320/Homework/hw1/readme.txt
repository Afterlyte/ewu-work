I created this latex sample article, in which I tried to input various option/choices/tricks, for you to use for homeworks. etc. Of course, the content has no sense. 

Download the attachment
unzip it into a directory. 
Open hw1.pdf in the directory, read it, and get what command to type if you use linux/mac command line terminals. 

If you use windows, one tool that uses latex is something callsed "winedit".  


Try to play around the sample article and get your on-hands experience. I believe you will have pain at the beginning and spend more time, but you will learn it since it's simpler than c/cpp/java programming of which you are already experts.  it also will be good in the future. 

if you cannot spend too much time for hw1, use MS word or some other tool to create your hw submission, then convert it into a pdf.   (if you want to do it like this always, it's also fine.)

Hope this would be helpful, and I believe by doing this we can save time from giving/listening a tutorial. 

Discuss/consult your peers and help each other when you are stuck.
