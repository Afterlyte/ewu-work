CSCD 350 Project Task 3.0 Part II: Requirements and Applicability

Ian Kaiserman

Inferred Requirements

The airplane shall be able to change direction on a horizontal plane.
The airplane shall be able to change speed and acceleration at varying rates.
The airplane shall be capable of movement on all axes in a three-dimensional space.
The airplane shall be able to turn on the Z axis at varying rates.

Inferred Applicability

Aircraft, Fighter - self-explanatory, a fighter aircraft operates very similarly to a commercial airplane.
Aircraft, Bomber - same as Aircraft, Fighter.
Battleship - some implementation of Mover, but is limited to movement in a 2D space so it would not benefit from things like vertical speed.
Missile - missiles with any sort of guidance would benefit from the movement programming through 3D space.
Submarine - movement through water in a 3D space is applicable here.
Torpedo - similar to missiles, if torpedoes have a guidance system they would benefit from programmed movement through at least 2D space, or situationally 3D space.
